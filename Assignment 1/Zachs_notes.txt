- calculated and filled in missing values of gallons, miles and mpg in 1.2.2
- why do we need to drop the null values of these again in the cell after the box plots 
- rather why dont we drop the missing values before the box plots and before the distributions

- it must be noted that the removal of null values and outliers are not perfoemd on "updated_df" and are only on the new dataframes that are created - I dont know if this is intentional or not

- keeping in mind the above point, for the cell/ question 1.2.5: when "updated_df.describe()" is used, this updated_df data frame does not have the outliers removed...so the statistical description will be wrong. 

- therefore the explaination / answer of this will be wrong / not representative of what the lecturer wants. 

- basically just worried about consistency, if we removed the outliers for the distrabutions, then the statistical description must ob with outliers removed. and visa versa


- unique users :
     - when do you guys want to drop the duplicates ... it needs to be done but where.
     - can it be in questions 3, and I do it inplce directly on to the updated_df

- question 3:
    - do you think its better to rather do day of the week ?

- question 4.1.2:
    - i think we should just saw where the conversion rate comes from, just as a comment, as it randomly appears heresince it was assigned a while back


- in  cell/question 4.2.8:
     copies df_top_5_crr_cleaned (df_cleaned) but gives it the same name, so nnp point in copying it.
