    "\n",
    "**1. Trip Duration Outliers**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analysis**: \n",
    "  - The first and third quartiles (Q1 and Q3) of trip duration are approximately 6.62 minutes and 17.92 minutes, respectively, resulting in an Interquartile Range (IQR) of 11.3 minutes.\n",
    "  - Outliers were identified as trips with durations below the lower bound of -10.33 minutes or above the upper bound of 34.87 minutes. Since negative durations are not possible, only the upper bound was considered.\n",
    "  - **Results**: After applying this threshold, 74,220 entries were removed, reducing the dataset from 1,458,644 to 1,384,424 entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Justification for Removal**:\n",
    "  - **Extreme durations**: Trips with durations significantly longer than the upper bound may result from data entry errors, traffic anomalies, or scenarios where the taxi meter was left running unintentionally. These extreme cases do not represent typical taxi trips and could distort the analysis of average trip times and patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Trip Distance Outliers**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analysis**:\n",
    "  - The IQR for trip distance was calculated as 2.29 km, with Q1 at 1.20 km and Q3 at 3.48 km. The lower bound was -2.23 km (which is not physically possible) and the upper bound was 6.91 km.\n",
    "  - **Results**: Applying this threshold removed 107,692 entries, reducing the dataset further to 1,276,732 entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Justification for Removal**:\n",
    "  - **Improbable distances**: Trips with distances far exceeding the upper bound may indicate unusually long journeys, possibly due to outliers in pickup/dropoff coordinates or GPS errors. These outliers could mislead any spatial analysis or skew results concerning the typical distance traveled in NYC.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Speed Outliers**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analysis**:\n",
    "  - For speed, the IQR was 7.49 km/h, with Q1 at 8.78 km/h and Q3 at 16.28 km/h, leading to a lower bound of -2.46 km/h (impossible for real trips) and an upper bound of 27.52 km/h.\n",
    "  - **Results**: This step removed 39,912 entries, leaving a final dataset of 1,236,820 entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Justification for Removal**:\n",
    "  - **Unrealistic speeds**: Extremely high speeds may occur due to incorrect time or distance calculations, possibly indicating data errors or misrecorded trips. Similarly, very low speeds could result from trips that involved significant waiting time, or errors where the vehicle might not have moved but the trip was recorded. Removing these ensures that the analysis focuses on realistic driving conditions, leading to more accurate insights into traffic patterns and trip efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers across trip duration, distance, and speed were systematically identified using boxplots and the IQR method. Removing these outliers is essential to maintain data integrity, representativeness, and statistical robustness in the analysis. The process ensures that the dataset accurately reflects typical taxi trips in NYC, enabling more reliable and meaningful conclusions from subsequent analyses."
